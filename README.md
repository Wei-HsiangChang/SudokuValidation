# SudokuValidation
Interact with user to validate the Sudoku 


How it works:

1. Ask the user to provide a minimum of first two rows of the Sudoku grid. For the rest of the entries, generate random numbers for the user
2. Data validation to ensure user enters exactly nine distinct and valid integers, no duplicate or non-numeric values or integers less than 1 or greater than 9 should be accepted;
3. Make random number generator generates distinct set of valid integers
4. Use multi-dimensional array to represent the grid;
5. The grid in a 9 x 9 matrix format, exmaine whether it forms a valid Sudoku solution or not;
